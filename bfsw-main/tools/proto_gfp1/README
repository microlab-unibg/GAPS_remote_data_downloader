brent sent me some raw data from the backend DAQ in its current state (as of August 19, 2021). 
The code in this folder parses the raw data and then transmits the packets over UDP into some
proto FSW that I wrote to handle the backend DAQ data.  This way we are running the full data
through the pipeline end to end.

The raw data file that brent sent is DAT_20210819_183105.dat
